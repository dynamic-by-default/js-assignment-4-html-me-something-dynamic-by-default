            <h3>How It All Started...</h3>
         </header>

      <p>
         Last night, Ricki made the most amazing fried chicken he has probably ever made in his entire life. It was
         sooo finger-licking good. Perfectly seasoned…a slight flaky crust that was just the right kind of
         crunchy…an almost buttery undertone…my God, my mouth is watering even as I am telling ya&#39;ll this
         story. I loved it so much that I woke up this morning with that chicken marinating in my thoughts.
         Fantasized about scarfing down that chicken as I forced myself through my breakfast. And when
         lunchtime finally dragged its feet around the corner, I went to the fridge looking for…? You guessed it.
         <strong>THE CHICKEN</strong>.

      <p>
         I&#39;m rummaging around in the fridge, right? Can&#39;t find the chicken. <em>I know I can&#39;t be that crazy. I
         specifically remember putting that chicken in this fridge…</em> I called my daughter into the kitchen to confirm
         what I thought I remembered. “Yes Mommy”, she affirmed. “I saw you do it.” <em> Then, where the heck
         did it go?!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
         Next, I called Ricki into the kitchen to inquire about the whereabouts of the missing chicken. He claimed
         he never touched it &amp; that it should still be in the fridge. He then walked over &amp; pulled everything out of
         said fridge. Ya&#39;ll...STILL NO CHICKEN! At this point, I&#39;m confused. The detective in me needed answers.
         &quot;Now, I know doggone good &amp; well I put that chicken in this fridge,&quot; I blurted out. Then, a sudden
         awareness hit me. Go to the trash can. So I started digging around in the trash can (maybe against my
         better judgment, but not for naught, because…) loe &amp; behold! The missing chicken...<strong>WAS IN THE TRASH</strong>.

            <h3>The Moment of Truth...</h3>
         </header>

      <p>Turns out, Ricki had accidentally thrown the chicken away that morning without first checking to see
         exactly what he was tossing out.

      <p>
         When I say I was so damn mad...
      </p>

      <p>
         I was BEYOND livid. I had my mouth ALL SET for that chicken. And I was starving on top of that! My
         anger at Ricki was further magnified by his being careless &amp; wasteful. I began thinking some pretty
         mean thoughts about him, &amp; even verbalized some of what I was thinking. But just as quickly as my
         emotions welled up within me, there came with them an awareness that I was only angry because I was,
         in that moment, entangled in negative thought patterns. My emotional mutiny was more a result of
         these counterproductive thought patterns &amp; less the result of what Ricki had done. These thought
         patterns don&#39;t align with who I AM &amp; what I desire out of life. They certainly are not thoughts I should
         be thinking about a person whom I so deeply love. A moment in nature &amp; some fresh air, that&#39;s what I
         need. I grabbed the book I&#39;m currently reading these days &amp; went outside to sit on the porch.

            <h3>The Reflection...</h3>
         </header> 

      <p>
         I began working with my thoughts by quietly reminding myself who I AM, while simultaneously reading a
         couple pages of my book. It took me maybe 5-10 minutes to move myself into a better thinking state. I
         then stood up, went back in the house, &amp; hugged Ricki. I felt the reluctance in his body. And I
         understood it because…I mean, who in their right mind yells at you in one minute, then lovingly
         embraces you in the next? I think he sensed my genuine feelings, though. After some time, he hugged
         me back. And we held each other until the energy between us shifted to a more positive note. When we
         let each other go, I apologized for flying off the handle &amp; reminded him (and myself) that it was just
         chicken &amp; not worth a conflict between us.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         So while I initially responded with anger to my discovery of the chicken in the trash can, I was able to
         stop myself in my tracks, objectively observe my thought pattern, &amp; then redirect myself back to where I
         was mentally prior to the contrasting event taking place. I then chose, rather than verbally assault my
         partner, to instead take ownership for my own mental choices by embracing him in love. By doing that,
         the situation in its entirety ended on a more positive note.

            <h3>The Aftermath...</h3>
         </header>
      
      <p>
         I am so proud of myself for this growth because I could NOT have done this a mere month ago. In
         hindsight, I am also grateful to Ricki for [accidentally] tossing that chicken in the trash. For me, this
         experience resulted in a much-needed lesson of love, patience, compassion, forgiveness &amp;
         accountability. Deep down, I want to grow. I crave growth. I look for growth &amp; expect it, too. Growth
         often comes by way of contrast. As such, it only stands to reason that to grow, I will experience
         opportunities of contrast which I can then use to facilitate the very growth I desire.
      </p>
      
      <p>I love Ricki for just being who he is. And while I sure would&#39;ve LOVED to have eaten more of that
         chicken, the opportunity to feel something so deeply &amp; spiritually gratifying satisfied me in ways that the
         chicken could not have.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Needless to say though...<strong>Ricki does still owe me a plate of chicken</strong>. (smile)
